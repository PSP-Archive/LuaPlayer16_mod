Homebrew developer cools dropped by the QJ.Net PSP Forums earlier today and unloaded Lua Player Mod 4. It should be remembered that Mod 3 was based on LuaPlayer v0.20. This release, on the other hand, was based on v0.16 which should make it faster. cools also mentioned that Mod 4 was built using the latest sdk and lua 5.1.2. Lua Player is a script player for your PlayStation Portable. Needless to say, it can run can run applications written in Lua, and it makes writing Lua code both faster and easier than writing for the PSP directly.
